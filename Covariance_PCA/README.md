This Notebook is created to explain the concepts of covariance matrix and how it
is related to variance and PCA. There is a geometric relation and we can use it
to decorrelate our datasets.

## Prerequisits for this tutorial:
- a working anaconda / miniconda environment.
- a shell (powershell / bash / or equivalent)

## Create the a new Python environment and download the required packages:
1) open a shell
2) conda create --name tutor python=3.7
3) conda activate tutor
4) pip install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyterlab

## Open Jupyter Lab in the working directory which has the Notebook and Data:
1) jupyter lab
2) In jupyter lab, open the notebook named: Principle component analysis and the covariance matrix.ipynb
